Young trees need regular watering until well-established, after which they are relatively drought-tolerant. During the growing season, especially when pecans are forming, regular watering is crucial to ensure nut quality and yield. However, be cautious of overwatering as it can lead to root rot. It's best to water deeply and infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings to promote healthy root growth.\"},{\"type\":\"sunlight\",\"description\":\"Pecan trees thrive in full sun, requiring at least six to eight hours of direct sunlight daily. Adequate sunlight exposure is essential for healthy growth, nut production, and the overall health of the tree. When planting, choose a location that provides ample sunlight throughout the day, avoiding areas with significant shade from other trees or structures. Ensure the site has enough space for the tree to grow to its full size without competing for sunlight, as they can reach large dimensions, impacting the light available to the canopy.\"},{\"type\":\"pruning\",\"description\":\"Pruning pecan trees is essential for maintaining their health and maximizing nut production. Prune during the dormant season, typically in late winter. Remove any dead, diseased, or crossing branches to improve air circulation and sunlight penetration within the canopy. Thin out crowded branches to maintain an open and balanced structure, which helps prevent disease and promotes better nut yields. Do not over-prune; removing too much can stress the tree and reduce nut production.
