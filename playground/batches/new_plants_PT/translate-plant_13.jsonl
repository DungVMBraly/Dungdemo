Pruning should be done before the plant blooms or produces new growth. During pruning, it is important to remove any dead, diseased, crossing, or weak branches in order to open up the canopy and promote healthy growth. Any shoots arising from the base of the tree can be removed if desired. Most branches can be thinned out in order to increase sunlight, air circulation, and reduce the tree's size. It is also important to shorten suckers or water sprouts that appear from the base of the tree and remove any branches growing inward or rubbing against 1 another. Lastly, you should never prune more than 25% of the tree during 1 season.\"}]}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"plant_info_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"number","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.

During particularly cold winter months, when temperatures can dip below 35 degrees Fahrenheit, Draba may benefit from some afternoon shade for protection.\"},{\"id\":10984,\"type\":\"pruning\",\"description\":\"Draba (Draba rigida var. bryoides) should be pruned twice a year, at the end of the winter season (March-April) and the end of the summer season (early September). Pruning should be done to maintain the overall shape and size of the plant, as well as to eliminate any dead or damaged branches. With minor pruning, the shrub can be trimmed to maintain its desired height and width. When undertaking major pruning, take care to remove no more than 1-third of the total branches annually. This helps maintain the natural structure of the Draba and prevents the plant from becoming overly stressed. Additionally, here are a few guidelines to follow when pruning your Draba:\\n\\n– Remove any dead, damaged or diseased branches.\\n\\n– Remove twiggy growth from the inside of the bush to improve air circulation, which will help the shrub look tidy and help reduce disease.\\n\\n– Thin the top of the shrub if it is too dense.\\n\\n– Prune out any crossing or rubbing branches.\\n\\n– Cut back and artistic group of branches growing in a linear direction.\\n\\n– Encourage more branching and more flowers by selectively removing the old flowering stalks at the point of origin, as this will help stimulate more vigorous flowering.\\n\\n– Cut back shoots in early spring to shape the shrub if necessary.\"}]}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"plant_info_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"number","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.

Once in the late spring and once in the summer. Upon establishing shape, minor pruning can be done regularly about once a month that will encourage new, more vigorous growth. Dead or damaged branches should be removed during pruning. The desired amount of pruning can vary depending on the intended shape and size of the plant, but the general idea is to remove no more than 1-third of the plant’s total foliage at any 1 time. This will ensure that the plant receives enough sunlight and airflow while remaining the desired size.

After establishment, water deeply once or twice a week (preferably in the morning) to keep the soil evenly moist at a depth of about 6 to 12 inches. During prolonged periods of heat or drought, increase watering to every 3-4 days. Avoid over-watering, which can cause nitrate build-up leading to a decrease in flowering.

Coneflowers are best grown in well-draining soil and should be watered deeply and regularly to maintain consistent moisture levels.

With this particular species, only the spent flowers should be pruned; avoid pruning back any of the leafy foliage. Pruning should be done in moderation, allowing enough foliage to remain to protect the plant from winter stressors, such as extreme temperatures and drought. Coneflower is a low-maintenance plant, and no more than a third of the plant should be removed during pruning.\"}]}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"plant_info_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"number","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.
