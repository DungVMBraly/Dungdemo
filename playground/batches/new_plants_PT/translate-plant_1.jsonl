Pruning should be done carefully and selectively as hornbeam trees can be susceptible to damage if over-pruned or pruned incorrectly. Trimming should focus on removing dead, diseased or broken branches and thinning out overgrown areas. If you would like to keep the canopy of the tree at a certain shape or size, this can also be done using selective pruning. When cutting branches, remember to make clean cuts at a 45 degree angle and 1-2 inches away from a bud or branch junction. Pruning too much may result in the tree becoming misshapen and unbalanced, so it is best to take a conservative approach and prune only what is necessary.\"}]}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"plant_info_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"number","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.
