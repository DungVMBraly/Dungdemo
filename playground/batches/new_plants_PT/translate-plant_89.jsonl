While the plant can tolerate full shade, it produces more flowers when exposed to adequate sunlight. Ideally, it should receive at least six hours of direct sunlight daily to encourage optimal blooming and lush growth. In hotter climates, it's beneficial to provide the plant with some afternoon shade to prevent leaf scorch. If grown in partial shade, expect fewer blooms. Ensure the site has good air circulation, which can support healthy growth and minimize the risk of fungal diseases. Adjust sunlight exposure according to the plant's performance and environment.\"},{\"type\":\"pruning\",\"description\":\"Pruning Lonicera fragrantissima should be done after the flowering period, which usually ends in late spring. This shrub benefits from annual pruning to maintain a desirable shape and encourage new growth. Remove any dead, damaged, or diseased wood using clean, sharp pruning shears. Thin out older, congested stems to improve air circulation and sun penetration. For rejuvenating older shrubs, more severe pruning may be necessary by cutting back some of the oldest stems to the ground to trigger new shoots. Light shaping and thinning can also help keep the plant neat and promote healthy growth.\"}],\"care_level\":\"Medium\",\"common_name\":\"Winter honeysuckle\",\"description\":\"Lonicera fragrantissima is a species of flowering plant in the honeysuckle family known by the common names winter honeysuckle, fragrant honeysuckle, January jasmine, Chinese honeysuckle, kiss-me-at-the-gate, and sweet breath of spring.
