You can also thin out overcrowded branches or reduce a branch’s length to promote better air circulation. Lastly, remove any suckers or fruit stalks that emerge from the base of the plant, as these can hinder growth. Always use sharp, clean pruning tools to avoid damage or disease transmission.

Prune any dead, broken, or cracked branches at any time of year, as well as any diseased branches or branches that are rubbing against another branch. For aesthetic purposes, pruning can also be done during the dormant season, from late fall to early spring. Rejuvenation pruning can be beneficial as the tree matures; selectively remove some large branches that are crossing or too close together. It is also important to thin out any competing branches that are too close to the dominant leader so the tree can grow straight and tall. Prune inner and lower branches, keeping the lower part of the tree open, as this can help reduce disease. Avoid large-scale pruning of this tree as too much can make it susceptible to shock and drought.\"}]}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"plant_info_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.

During the winter/spring pruning, aim to maintain the plant's natural shape while removing any dead, damaged or crossing branches as needed. Be sure to prune off any fruits that may be produced by the plant as this will limit its size and shape. For the late summer pruning, focus on cutting back any new growth to prevent the plant from becoming too large and dense. Depending on the individual plant, pruning can be done to a varying degree, but it should generally be done to remove average- to high-growth stems to ensure balanced growth and to create desired shape and size.\"}]}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"plant_info_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"number","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.

Pruning in the late autumn or winter is less desirable because it can stimulate new growth that will be damaged by cold temperatures. To maintain a good shape and size for an Oriental Hornbeam, it should be thinned by removing as much as 1/3 of the smaller branches each year. Larger branches can be pruned in early summer and late winter as needed.

This species of tree is typically pruned to remove dead or diseased branches, and to help maintain its vase-like shape. Young trees should be pruned routinely for the first several years to promote a strong, healthy frame. Avoid removing more than 1-third of the existing live branches during the pruning process. If spent flowers and fruits are observed, pruning those at the same time can also be beneficial.\"}]}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"plant_info_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"number","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.

Pruning too heavily or removing more than 15-20 percent of the tree’s foliage will make it vulnerable to disease.
