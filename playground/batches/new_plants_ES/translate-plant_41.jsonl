It spreads quickly by stolons and looks beautiful cascading over stone walls or when used as a tiny lawn alternative. Its compact size makes it ideal for restricted spaces, and its low-maintenance care needs make it a great choice for the lazy gardener.\",\"family\":\"Plantaginaceae\",\"flower_color\":\"Blue\",\"flowering_season\":null,\"fruit_color\":[],\"growth_rate\":\"Low\",\"harvest_season\":null,\"leaf_color\":[],\"maintenance\":\"Low\",\"origin\":[\"United Kingdom\"],\"other_name\":[],\"pest_susceptibility\":[],\"propagation\":[\"Division\",\"Cutting\",\"Layering Propagation\",\"Seed Propagation\",\"Division\"],\"pruning_month\":[\"March\",\"April\",\"May\",\"June\",\"July\",\"August\",\"March\",\"April\",\"May\",\"June\",\"July\",\"August\"],\"scientific_name\":[\"Veronica prostrata 'Trehane'\"],\"soil\":[],\"watering_period\":null}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"plant_info_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"number","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.
