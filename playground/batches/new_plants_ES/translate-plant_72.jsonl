If cultivating this fungus, simulate a woodland environment with indirect light or partial shade to mimic its natural habitat conditions.\"},{\"type\":\"pruning\",\"description\":\"Mutinus ravenelii does not require pruning since it is a fungus and does not grow like a typical plant with leaves or branches.
