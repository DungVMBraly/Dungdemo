Depending on how fast it grows, pruning can be done every 1 to 3 years. Late winter is usually the best time to prune, before new growth begins. Start by removing any damaged, diseased or dead branches. Prune again in the summer, trimming the plant back further. Shape the plant by removing any inner or outer branches that spoil the uniform look, and also remove any branches crossing over each other or rubbing against each other. Prune just above a bud to encourage branching. If needed, prune again in the fall when the plant has finished flowering. Pruning should aim to maintain the desired shape and size.\"}]}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"plant_info_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.

During the growing season (spring and summer months) the soil should be kept moist but not soggy. Water your Divi-Divi plant once every 7-10 days, allowing the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings. During the winter months, reduce watering considerably, only watering when the top inch of soil feels completely dry. Make sure to water the soil completely and not just the surface, as this can lead to root rot.\"},{\"id\":8289,\"type\":\"sunlight\",\"description\":\"Divi-divi plants should be grown in an area that receives full sunlight for 6 to 8 hours a day. Divi-divi plants require full sun during the morning hours and should be given partial to full shade during the afternoon hours.

The best time for pruning divi-divi is during its dormancy season, which usually occurs in late fall or early winter. During the growing season, only prune limbs that are overly long or have dead or diseased growth. Heavy pruning is not recommended as this can rob the plant of its beautiful shape and detract from the overall health of the tree. To prune during the dormant season, cut back limbs that are diseased or dead, as well as any limbs that are taking away from the general shape of the tree. Be careful not to prune more than 1-third of the tree's total mass, as this can significantly alter the shape and health of the tree. When finished pruning, you may want to apply a fungicide or insecticide to the pruned areas to prevent disease or insect infestation.\"}]}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"plant_info_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.

With proper watering and attention to its environment, camellias (Camellia japonica 'April Rose') can thrive.\"},{\"id\":8484,\"type\":\"sunlight\",\"description\":\"Camellia japonica 'April Rose' is a popular plant species which prefers full sunlight and should receive a minimum of 4 hours per day. However, depending on where in the world it is planted, the intensity of sunlight during these hours can vary greatly. If planted in an area with higher UV index, the plant should be given less intense sunlight for a longer duration. In those areas, 6 to 8 hours of sunlight, but with softer intensities, should be given to optimize the growth and overall health of the plant.\\n\\nWhen planting in cooler climates with less sunlight, the 'April Rose' should receive direct sun throughout the day with a minimum of 4 hours per day, or should enjoy a warm, bright spot in a sunny window. Exposure to bright sunlight stimulates flowering, deepens the color of blooms, and encourages plant growth. Too little sunlight may result in fewer blooms and leaves that are lighter in color, so it is important to ensure that the plant is getting enough sunlight on a daily basis.\"},{\"id\":8485,\"type\":\"pruning\",\"description\":\"The best time to prune Camellia japonica ‘April Rose’ is in late winter or early spring, just before new growth emerges. This will prevent the plant from losing too many flowers next season and, depending on how much pruning you do in 1 session, will help to maintain its desired shape. Generally, it’s best to prune to maintain the shape of the plant, and remove dead or diseased branches as necessary. It's also important to avoid pruning too deeply into green wood as this can cause some damage. The amount of pruning that’s needed depends on the shape of the plant and on personal preference. In general, it’s best to remove no more than 1-third of the total plant material in any 1 pruning session.\"}]}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"plant_info_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.

As a general rule, boxwoods require at least 4 hours of direct sunlight per day; however, it is best to avoid prolonged direct sun during hot summer months.

However, if you're looking to shape the boxwood, you can cut away a bit more. The important thing is to avoid removing more than 1-third of the plant's living green foliage—doing so can be very damaging to the boxwood. Also, make sure to cut just above the leaf node in order to get a cleaner, straighter cut.\"}]}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"plant_info_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"number","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.

Start by removing any weak or crossing stems that are not producing desirable blooms, as well as any stems that are not as full and healthy looking. For each stem, make the cut just above where the next bud is located. To keep the shape of the shrub or plant clean, snip off any leaves or stems that stick out beyond the shape. Each stem should be pruned to at least 5 or 6 buds. If there are any dead stems or shoots, make sure to remove them altogether. Pruning will encourage the plant to sprout new stems and blooms, making for a fuller appearance. Performing pruning in the aforementioned manner will help ensure that your slipper flower will remain healthy and bloom successfully in the future.\"}]}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"plant_info_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"number","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.

When pruning, make sure to leave the center of the plant untouched as it will help ensure even growth. During late summer, prune the plant more aggressively to limit height and prevent overly lush growth. If pruning heavily, it is best to do it late in the season when the plant is no longer actively growing. Pruning late also helps maintain the plant's shape into the fall. Finally, lightly prune the plant in late fall to shape it in preparation for the winter months.\"}]}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"plant_info_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"number","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.

It’s important not to over-water pepper plants as this can lead to root rot. Ensure the soil is dry to the touch before adding more water.

Pruning should be done once a month from late spring until early summer, though this can be done more or less frequently depending on the start of the plant’s growth season in your area.\\n\\nTo prune pepper plants, snip off any old, dead, or diseased branches. Cut off branches and stems that grow more than 6 inches above the desired height, as well as branches that are spindly and not producing much fruit. This will promote new growth and help the plant to focus its energy on producing peppers. Remove any pesky weeds near the base of the plant as well, as these can rob the plant of energy and resources.\"}]}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"plant_info_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"number","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.
