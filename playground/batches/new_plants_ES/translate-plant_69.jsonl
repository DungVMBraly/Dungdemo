However, ensure good drainage as overly waterlogged soil can lead to root rot. Mulching around the base can help retain soil moisture and reduce watering frequency.

However, ensure good drainage as overly waterlogged soil can lead to root rot. Mulching around the base can help retain soil moisture and reduce watering frequency.
