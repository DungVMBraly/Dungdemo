Cut back any low-growing branches that are blocking pathways or crowding out other plants. Then, continue to prune out any dead, broken, or diseased branches.

To prune your spurge, start by cutting off any dead, diseased, or damaged stems. Once this is done, you can begin to shape your plant by removing approximately 1/3 of the longest stems from the interior of the plant. Additionally, you can trim any stems that are growing onto or outside of the plant's desired shape. Lastly, trim off any dried or yellowed leaves. This type of pruning should be done once a year to ensure healthy and vigorous growth.\"}]}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"plant_info_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.

This plant species is usually slow growing and low maintenance, so minimal pruning is necessary. In fact, it's best to lightly prune the plant every year by removing a few dead branches or shoots here and there. However, if you want to shape the tree, you can prune it back more heavily. Be careful not to cut into the trunk or divide its limbs too severely - pruning in this way can damage or kill the tree.\"}]}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"plant_info_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"number","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.

To keep the Euphorbia 'Imperfant' EFANTHIA looking its best and maintain its natural shape, pruning should be done so that no more than 25% of the plant is removed at any 1 time.\"}]}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"plant_info_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"number","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.

Generally speaking, water the greenstem forsythia deeply once every 10 to 13 days in cooler weather and every 7 to 10 days in warmer weather. Make sure the soil is damp to the touch but not overly wet. Mulching around the base of the plant can help keep soil moisture consistent.

It tolerates full sun to partial shade, although full sun is best for optimum flowering. It needs at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day in order for it to grow and bloom properly. The best time for sunlight for this plant is 10am-4pm daily for optimum flowering.

Prune in late winter just before new spring growth begins, and again in mid summer after flowers have faded. When pruning during winter, wait until after all the cold weather has passed. This will help reduce the potential of dieback from frost damage. Be sure to remove any deadwood first, as well as any overly-long branches that may have grown beyond the desired shape of the plant. When pruning in mid-summer, conservatively trim back only the spent flower heads, and avoid shearing the plant. Shearing will decrease the width and density of the entire shrub. New flowering branches should only be cut back when absolutely necessary, such as when a branch is growing too tall. Make sure to leave at least a few inches between new cuts and previous cuts. This will help promote branching and increase the density of the shrub.\"}]}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"plant_info_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"number","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.
