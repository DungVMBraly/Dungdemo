It is important to keep the soil consistently moist, especially during its first growing season, to establish a strong root system. However, avoid over-watering as it can lead to root rot. Once established, wisteria is fairly drought-tolerant, but it will bloom more profusely with regular watering. Aim to water deeply once a week during dry periods, ensuring the water reaches deep into the root zone, but allow the top inch of soil to dry out between watering sessions.\"},{\"type\":\"sunlight\",\"description\":\"Wisteria floribunda thrives in full sun, requiring at least six to eight hours of direct sunlight each day for optimal blooming. While it can tolerate partial shade, its flowering may be significantly reduced. A sunny south or west-facing spot is ideal to ensure the plant receives ample sunlight. If possible, provide exposure to morning sun to help dry off foliage early in the day, reducing the likelihood of diseases. Adequate sunlight encourages robust growth and an abundant display of its beautiful, cascading flowers.\"},{\"type\":\"pruning\",\"description\":\"Pruning is crucial for maintaining the shape and encouraging the blooms of Wisteria floribunda. Prune twice a year: once in late winter and again in the summer. In winter, cut back lateral shoots to 2-3 buds to encourage flower production. Summer pruning involves trimming the long shoots from the current year’s growth back to about six inches, promoting a tidy appearance and future flowering.

It performs best with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day, which encourages prolific flowering and vigorous growth. In hotter climates, providing some afternoon shade can protect the plant from excessive heat and prevent leaf scorch. In less sunny areas, ensure that the plant receives as much light as possible to avoid leggy growth and a reduced number of blooms.
