It is important to ensure that the soil remains consistently moist, particularly during its active growing season in spring and summer. Avoid letting the soil dry out completely between waterings. However, do not overwater, as the plant does not tolerate water-logged conditions well. Utilize a well-draining soil mix to aid in proper water management.
