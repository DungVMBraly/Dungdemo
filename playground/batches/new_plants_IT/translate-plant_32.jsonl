The dense foliage is a varied mix of deep-green and silvery blue lance-shaped leaves. Barely reaching 8 inches in height, polyanthus is often used as a groundcover. It prefers a cool, moist environment and is ideal for rock gardens, container gardens and edging.\",\"family\":\"Primulaceae\",\"flower_color\":\"Most colors except green\",\"flowering_season\":null,\"fruit_color\":[],\"growth_rate\":\"Low\",\"harvest_season\":null,\"leaf_color\":[\"green\"],\"maintenance\":\"Moderate\",\"origin\":[\"England\",\"Scotland\",\"Wales\",\"Ireland\"],\"other_name\":[],\"pest_susceptibility\":[],\"propagation\":[\"Division\",\"Cutting\",\"Seed Propagation\",\"Layering Propagation\"],\"pruning_month\":[\"May\",\"May\"],\"scientific_name\":[\"Primula (polyanthus type)\"],\"soil\":[],\"watering_period\":\"morning\"}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"plant_info_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"number","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.
