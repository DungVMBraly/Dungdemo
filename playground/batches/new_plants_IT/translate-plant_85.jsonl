It's important to ensure that the soil is dry before watering again to prevent overwatering, which could lead to root rot. In general, provide water once every two weeks, adjusting based on local climate conditions. During prolonged dry spells or extreme heat, you might need to water more frequently, but always ensure proper drainage to avoid waterlogged soil. Mulching can help retain soil moisture and reduce the frequency of watering.\"},{\"type\":\"sunlight\",\"description\":\"Parthenium confertum thrives in full sunlight but is tolerant of partial shade. Ideally, it should receive at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth. In too much shade, the plant might become leggy and produce fewer blooms. Ensure it's planted in a location where it will not be shaded by larger plants or structures for most of the day. In extremely hot climates, a bit of afternoon shade can protect the plant from intense midday sun and heat stress. Consistent sunlight exposure will help maintain its robust growth and flowering.\"},{\"type\":\"pruning\",\"description\":\"Pruning Parthenium confertum is not always necessary unless you're managing its growth or preventing it from spreading aggressively. If pruning is needed, do so in the early spring before new growth starts. Use sharp, clean tools to cut back overgrown or damaged stems to promote healthier growth. Regularly remove any dead or diseased foliage to maintain plant health. Caution is advised as this plant might cause allergic reactions due to its pollen, so wearing gloves and protective clothing when pruning is recommended.\"}],\"care_level\":\"Medium\",\"common_name\":\"Gray's feverfew\",\"description\":null,\"family\":null,\"flower_color\":\"White\",\"flowering_season\":false,\"fruit_color\":null,\"growth_rate\":\"Moderate\",\"harvest_season\":null,\"leaf_color\":[\"Green\"],\"maintenance\":\"Moderate\",\"origin\":[\"Mexico\",\"Central America\"],\"other_name\":[\"Gray's feverfew\"],\"pest_susceptibility\":[\"Fungal leaf spot\"],\"propagation\":[\"Seed Propagation\"],\"pruning_month\":[\"July\"],\"scientific_name\":[\"Parthenium confertum\"],\"soil\":[\"Well-drained\",\"Loamy\"],\"watering_period\":\"Morning\"}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"plant_info_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"number","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.
