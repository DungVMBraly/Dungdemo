Allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings, as this plant does not like to sit in overly moist soil and can develop root rot if overwatered.

For best growth and flowering, provide it with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight each day. When planted in a location with less sunlight, the plant may grow leggy and produce fewer flowers, reducing its overall decorative appeal. In very hot climates, some afternoon shade can help prevent leaf burn. Placing it in a south-facing spot or another sunny location will help it maintain its vibrant variegated foliage and white bracts, which are its main ornamental features.\"},{\"type\":\"pruning\",\"description\":\"Pruning Euphorbia marginata is beneficial for encouraging a more compact growth habit and removing any dead or damaged stems. The best time to prune is early in the spring before new growth begins. Use clean, sharp pruning shears to make cuts just above a node or healthy leaf set. Be cautious of the plant's milky sap, which can be irritating; wear gloves to protect your skin.
