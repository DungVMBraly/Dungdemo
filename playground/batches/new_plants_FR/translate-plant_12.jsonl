The sunlight exposure needs for this plant species vary depending on the time of year, but generally it should receive at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day. During the spring and summer months, when there are more hours of daytime sunlight, they can do well with as much as 10-12 hours of direct sunlight each day. However, in the colder winter months when the days are shorter, they may need as little as 4-6 hours of direct sunlight in order to thrive.\"},{\"id\":10645,\"type\":\"pruning\",\"description\":\"Maiden Pink (Dianthus deltoides ‘Albus’) should be pruned twice a year. In early spring, just as the plant starts to produce new growth, it should be cut back to 6-8 inches. This will encourage new growth and blooms to form. In late spring after the flowers have faded, prune them back again, this time more severely, to 4-5 inches. Pruning encourages the plant to branch more, producing a bushier form and more blooms in the future. It is also important to remove any dead or diseased stems as soon as they appear.\"}]}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"plant_info_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"number","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.
