This species attaches to the limbs of Douglas Fir trees and does not produce its own leaves; instead relying on the tree for nutrients and water. The small, yellow-green stems are speckled with small, greenish-yellow flowers that grow in clusters. The species produces seeds with sticky pillows that help it spread easily from tree to tree. While the plant does not pose a major threat to the tree, it does reduce its overall health and vigor and can ultimately stunt the tree's growth.\",\"family\":\"Loranthaceae\",\"flower_color\":\"\",\"flowering_season\":null,\"fruit_color\":[],\"growth_rate\":\"Low\",\"harvest_season\":null,\"leaf_color\":[],\"maintenance\":null,\"origin\":[\"United States\",\"Canada\",\"Mexico\",\"Guatemala\",\"Honduras\",\"Costa Rica\",\"Nicaragua\",\"Panama\"],\"other_name\":[],\"pest_susceptibility\":[],\"propagation\":[\"Seed Propagation\",\"Seed Propagation\",\"Seed Propagation\",\"Seed Propagation\",\"Artificial Propagation\"],\"pruning_month\":[\"March\",\"April\"],\"scientific_name\":[\"Arceuthobium douglasii\"],\"soil\":[],\"watering_period\":\"morning\"}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"plant_info_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"number","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.
