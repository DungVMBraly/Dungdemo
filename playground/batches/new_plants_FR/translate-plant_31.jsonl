Pruning back old growth can help the plant to remain compact and lush. Green Dragon adds texture and color to a shade garden; its bright flowers bring cheer when other plants are dormant in winter. Thriving in moist environments, it's ideal for planting near water features or streams.\",\"family\":\"Araceae\",\"flower_color\":\"Green\",\"flowering_season\":null,\"fruit_color\":[],\"growth_rate\":\"Low\",\"harvest_season\":null,\"leaf_color\":[\"gold\",\"green\",\"yellow\"],\"maintenance\":\"Low\",\"origin\":[\"China\"],\"other_name\":[],\"pest_susceptibility\":[],\"propagation\":[\"Division\",\"Seed Propagation\",\"Cutting\",\"Layering Propagation\"],\"pruning_month\":[\"May\"],\"scientific_name\":[\"Pinellia tripartita 'Gold Dragon'\"],\"soil\":[],\"watering_period\":\"morning\"}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"plant_info_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.
