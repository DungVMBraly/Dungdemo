Cheatgrass thrives in disturbed areas with full sun and dry conditions, and is aggressive in out-competing native vegetation. Its deep root system makes it drought tolerant. Unfortunately, its presence can lead to more frequent and intense wildfires. Cut or mowed, cheatgrass can re-sprout quickly. Its seed can survive in the soil for up to 10 years, so eradication is very difficult.\",\"family\":\"Poaceae\",\"flower_color\":\"\",\"flowering_season\":null,\"fruit_color\":[],\"growth_rate\":\"High\",\"harvest_season\":null,\"leaf_color\":[\"green\",\"yellow\"],\"maintenance\":null,\"origin\":[\"Europe\",\"Asia\",\"North Africa\",\"North America\"],\"other_name\":[\"Downy Chess\"],\"pest_susceptibility\":[],\"propagation\":[\"Seed Propagation\",\"Seed Propagation\",\"Seed Propagation\",\"Seed Propagation\",\"Seed Propagation\"],\"pruning_month\":[\"May\"],\"scientific_name\":[\"Bromus tectorum\"],\"soil\":[],\"watering_period\":null}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"plant_info_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"number","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.
