For optimum bloom and health, pruning should be done once a year in the late winter or early spring when the plant is dormant. Begin by cutting off the flower stalks just above the base of the plant. This will encourage new growth and a more robust bloom in the summer. If the plant becomes crowded in the center or begins to flop over, you can also cut back some of the stems to within 2-3 inches of the ground. This will allow the plant to re-sprout from the base and become more compact. Use sharp, clean pruners or scissors to keep the cuts neat.

Removal of spent flowers and dead stems throughout the growing season will maintain a neat appearance and encourage additional flowering. Cut off flower heads leaving just 1-2 inches of stems. This will force new growth and encourage a second bloom. Make sure to remove any diseased foliage or dead stems immediately throughout the growing season.

Since this species is a perennial, the best time to prune is after the coldest temperatures of the year have passed. This will give the plant a healthy start to the growing season and vitalize new blooms come summer. When pruning your purple coneflowers, trim the plants to anywhere between 6-12 in (15-30 cm) to encourage bushier, more compact plants and more abundant flowers.
