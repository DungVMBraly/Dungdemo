If growing indoors or in areas with limited sunlight, consider supplementing with a grow light to meet its sunlight needs. Ensure that the plant receives bright, direct light to encourage healthy development and vibrant blooms.\"},{\"type\":\"pruning\",\"description\":\"Pruning Heliophila subulata involves removing dead or damaged stems to promote healthy growth and maintain a tidy appearance.
