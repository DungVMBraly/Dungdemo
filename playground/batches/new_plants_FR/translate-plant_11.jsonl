Pruning should be light and selective, removing only a few of the oldest and most damaged stems. This will help improve the shape of the plant and stimulate new growth and flowering. Pruning should not be done in summer or fall, as this can stress the plant and cause dieback. If desired, a light pruning can be done in summer once the flowering has ended. Avoid cutting beyond the desired shape or removing too many branches, as this can result in an unbalanced and lopsided shrub.\"}]}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"plant_info_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.

Pruning during winter dormancy can also be beneficial to determine the size and shape of your dogwood. If the plant was neglected for a few years, vigorous pruning can help control its size and shape. Prune the branches back to an outward facing bud – this will encourage growth and fuller foliage. When pruning, it is important to use sharp, clean, pruning shears, taking care to cut just enough to keep the plant in a desired shape and size. Pruning more than about a third of the total branches should be avoided.\"}]}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"plant_info_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.

You should remove any dead leaves and stems that have been damaged by cold weather. If the taro plant has become too large for its container, you can prune off the top growth and the roots to encourage branching and the plant to stay contained and healthy. Prune back the side leaves that are growing out of the main stem so that the plant has an even shape. You should also remove any flowers stalks before the blooms open, as these can sap the energy from the plant. Finally, you can lightly trim back any weak or broken stems to help promote new growth.

Prune off the tips of overgrown or leggy canes when they reach more than 3 feet in height. This will help encourage bushier growth and overall shape. Prune off the lowest leaves on the stem of the taro plant in late winter to early spring to reduce possible disease and pest problems. Prune more severely if the plant is large and overgrown.

It prefers at least 6 hours of sunshine per day to ensure that it can uptake the energy from the sun to power its growth. Early morning or late afternoon sun is best, as the direct sun in the middle of the day can be too intense for the plant and cause it to burn. If planted in an area that receives full sun all day, it is critical to make sure there is adequate protection from extremely hot temperatures or prolonged exposure to direct sunlight. This species is highly tolerant of all soil conditions, but does appreciate moist, well-drained soil for optimal growth.\"},{\"id\":10159,\"type\":\"pruning\",\"description\":\"The cockspur thorn (Crataegus crus-galli (thornless form)) is best pruned in early spring before it begins to grow or in late winter if it is already growing. Prune off any weak or dead stems, focusing on removing any stems that are more than a few years old. If old branches are crossed, rub off or thin their crowded growth to minimize disease. Ideally, pruning should be done while also preserving the natural form of the cockspur thorn. If greater reduction is required, begin carefully and leave a few buds on the main trunk and side branches to make sure that new growth is retained. In addition, pruning should leave plenty of room between stems and branches to allow for good air circulation. \"}]}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"plant_info_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"number","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.
