It requires regular watering to maintain its lush appearance, but be cautious to avoid waterlogged conditions, which can lead to root rot. In its natural habitat, it often flourishes in areas with enough rainfall to keep the soil damp. During dry spells or in areas with less rainfall, supplemental watering might be necessary. It's advisable to water deeply but less frequently to encourage deeper root growth, which enhances the plant's drought tolerance over time.\"},{\"type\":\"sunlight\",\"description\":\"Agrostis hyemalis thrives best in full sun to partial shade. It typically requires at least four to six hours of direct sunlight each day to grow optimally. In very hot climates, providing some afternoon shade can be beneficial to prevent excessive drying or heat stress. However, in cooler climates or during cooler seasons, more direct sunlight can enhance its growth and vigor. It's adaptable to different light conditions, but its growth may become sparse in too much shade, where it might not receive enough energy from sunlight to maintain a dense appearance.\"},{\"type\":\"pruning\",\"description\":\"Pruning Agrostis hyemalis is a straightforward process. In early spring, before new growth starts, it's beneficial to cut back the old, dried foliage to about a couple of inches above the soil level. This helps to remove any dead material and encourages fresh growth. Throughout the growing season, you can also remove any dead or damaged leaves as needed. If the grass is used in a lawn setting, regular mowing may be required to maintain a tidier appearance, but otherwise minimal pruning is needed. Always use clean and sharp tools to prevent disease transmission.\"}],\"care_level\":\"Easy\",\"common_name\":\"Winter Bentgrass\",\"description\":null,\"family\":null,\"flower_color\":null,\"flowering_season\":false,\"fruit_color\":null,\"growth_rate\":\"Moderate\",\"harvest_season\":null,\"leaf_color\":[\"Green\"],\"maintenance\":\"Low\",\"origin\":[\"North America\"],\"other_name\":[\"Winter Bentgrass\"],\"pest_susceptibility\":[],\"propagation\":[\"Seed Propagation\"],\"pruning_month\":[\"July\"],\"scientific_name\":[\"Agrostis hyemalis\"],\"soil\":[\"Well-drained\",\"Loamy\",\"Sandy\",\"Clay\"],\"watering_period\":\"Morning\"}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"plant_info_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"number","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.
