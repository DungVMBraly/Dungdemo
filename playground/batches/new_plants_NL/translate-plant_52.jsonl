Instead, ensure it is kept in a water environment with consistent water quality. The water should be moderately hard to soft, and maintaining a stable pH between 5.0 to 8.0 is recommended. Regular water changes, about 20% weekly, can help keep it healthy, free from debris, and prevent algae growth. Keep the water temperature between 70°F and 80°F (21°C - 27°C) for optimal growth. Given its aquatic nature, it instead absorbs water nutrients through its entire structure, so consistent nutrient-rich water is vital.\"},{\"type\":\"sunlight\",\"description\":\"Riccia fluitans thrives under moderate to high lighting conditions. In an aquarium setting, this can be achieved with LED or fluorescent lights, providing around 10 to 12 hours of light per day. This ensures optimal photosynthesis, which supports its lush, green growth. While it adapts well to different light intensities, inadequate lighting may result in slow growth or browning. Conversely, intense lighting encourages a compact growth habit. Ensure that aquarium lighting is evenly distributed to prevent shading, which can inhibit its growth. Balancing light exposure with CO2 availability and nutrient levels further supports its growth.\"},{\"type\":\"pruning\",\"description\":\"Regular pruning is essential for Riccia fluitans to prevent it from becoming too dense and shading itself or other plants in the aquarium. Trim the plant with scissors or appropriate aquascaping tools every few weeks, especially when it starts to form dense mats. Remove any dead or yellowing portions to prevent decay and nutrient spikes in the water. Careful pruning also helps manage its buoyancy, preventing excessive spread across the water surface. Pruning not only maintains the aesthetic appeal of Riccia fluitans but also promotes healthier growth by providing adequate light penetration and water flow.\"}],\"care_level\":\"Easy\",\"common_name\":\"Floating Crystalwort\",\"description\":\"Riccia fluitans, whose common name is floating crystalwort, is an aquatic floating plant of the liverwort genus Riccia which is popular among aquarists as a retreat for young fry and is used in live-bearing tanks.
