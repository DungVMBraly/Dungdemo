It is important not to let the soil dry out completely, especially during the growing season. Water the plant moderately, ensuring the soil remains consistently moist but not waterlogged. In hot and dry conditions, watering may need to be increased. Be sure to water at the base of the plant rather than overhead to prevent mildew. A good mulch layer can help retain moisture and reduce the frequency of watering.\"},{\"type\":\"sunlight\",\"description\":\"Aquilegia vulgaris thrives best in a location that receives partial to full sun. Ideally, it should have a few hours of morning sun followed by afternoon shade to protect it from intense heat, which can cause the flowers to fade more quickly. In warmer climates, ensure it’s planted in an area that provides some shade during the hottest part of the day. Too much shade can reduce blooming, so finding the right balance is key for optimal growth and flowering. In cooler climates, more direct sunlight is usually beneficial.\"},{\"type\":\"pruning\",\"description\":\"Pruning Aquilegia vulgaris involves removing spent flowers to encourage more blooms and extend the flowering period. After flowering, cut the stems back to the basal foliage to tidy up the plant and prevent self-seeding if this is not desired. In late autumn or early spring, remove dead or damaged foliage.
