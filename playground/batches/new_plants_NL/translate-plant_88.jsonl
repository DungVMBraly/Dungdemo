During the fall and winter months, the plant requires less frequent watering, approximately once every couple of weeks or when the soil feels dry to the touch. Mulching around the base can help retain soil moisture and reduce the frequency of watering.\"},{\"type\":\"sunlight\",\"description\":\"Amelanchier ovalis thrives in full sun to partial shade.
