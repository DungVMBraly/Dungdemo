It’s important to water these plants regularly, especially during dry spells, to maintain soil moisture. However, allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings to prevent root rot. During the growing season, frequent watering is beneficial, but in the winter months, reduce the watering frequency as the plant’s growth slows. Mulching can help retain soil moisture and reduce the need for frequent watering.\"},{\"type\":\"sunlight\",\"description\":\"Rubus parviflorus thrives in partial to full sunlight. Ideally, it should receive about 4 to 6 hours of direct sunlight per day for optimal growth. However, it can tolerate partial shade, especially in hotter climates, where protection from the afternoon sun is beneficial. If planted in too much shade, the plant may produce fewer flowers and fruits. Full sun conditions can enhance flower and fruit production, but ensure that the plant is not subjected to scorching and drying conditions by providing partial shelter if necessary.\"},{\"type\":\"pruning\",\"description\":\"Pruning Rubus parviflorus is essential for maintaining its health and encouraging robust growth. After the plant flowers, it is best to prune immediately to remove dead or weak stems, which can help improve air circulation. Thinning out older canes will allow new, more vigorous canes to establish. Aim to prune in late winter or early spring before new growth begins. Regular pruning keeps the plant looking tidy and prevents it from becoming overly dense, which can make it more susceptible to pests and diseases.\"}],\"care_level\":\"Easy\",\"common_name\":\"thimbleberry\",\"description\":\"Rubus parviflorus, commonly called thimbleberry, is a species of Rubus native to North America.\",\"family\":null,\"flower_color\":\"White\",\"flowering_season\":false,\"fruit_color\":\"[\\\"Red\\\"]\",\"growth_rate\":\"Moderate\",\"harvest_season\":\"Summer\",\"leaf_color\":[\"Green\"],\"maintenance\":\"Low\",\"origin\":[\"North America\"],\"other_name\":[\"thimbleberry\"],\"pest_susceptibility\":[\"Cane Borer\"],\"propagation\":[\"Seed Propagation\",\"Cutting\"],\"pruning_month\":[\"March\"],\"scientific_name\":[\"Rubus parviflorus\"],\"soil\":[\"Well-drained\",\"Loamy\"],\"watering_period\":\"Morning\"}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"plant_info_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"number","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.
