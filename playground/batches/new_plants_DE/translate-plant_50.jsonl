The vibrant blooms make it a popular choice for flower beds and wildflower gardens.\",\"family\":\"Orobanchaceae\",\"flower_color\":\"\",\"flowering_season\":null,\"fruit_color\":[],\"growth_rate\":\"Low\",\"harvest_season\":null,\"leaf_color\":[],\"maintenance\":null,\"origin\":[\"Alaska\"],\"other_name\":[],\"pest_susceptibility\":[],\"propagation\":[\"Seed Propagation\",\"Seed Propagation\",\"Seed Propagation\",\"Seed Propagation\",\"Division\",\"Cutting\",\"Layering Propagation\"],\"pruning_month\":[\"March\",\"April\",\"May\",\"June\",\"July\"],\"scientific_name\":[\"Castilleja unalaschcensis\"],\"soil\":[],\"watering_period\":null}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"plant_info_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"number","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.
