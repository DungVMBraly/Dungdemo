They need some direct sunlight each morning to help them photosynthesize and grow properly. Also, indirect sunlight throughout the day helps them stay healthy. Shade growing plants will benefit from the sunshine, but if they get too much or too little, then they can suffer the consequences. It's important to pay attention to the needs of your plants so that you can provide them with the proper light for optimal growth.\"}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"diseases_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"number","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.

A helpful technique to determine your plants' watering needs is to feel the soil before and after watering to get a sense of how long it takes to dry out. An important note to remember is that some plants require less water than others, and it's best to research the specific needs of your individual plants. Likewise, if your home is very dry, you might need to water more often as the lack of moisture can stress the plants and lead to problems like brown leaves and wilted stems.\"}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"diseases_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"number","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.

Root rot is a fungal disease that can be caused by over-watering, poor soil drainage, or high humidity levels in the air. Signs of root rot include yellowing leaves, wilting and stunted growth, and damaged or browning root systems. Sometimes it is difficult to detect root rot until the plant is removed from the soil, as the problems are mainly below the soil surface. Treating root rot usually involves removing the affected parts of the plant and replanting the unaffected ones.\"}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"diseases_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"number","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.

Monstera plants need warm, humid air to thrive, and direct sunlight can scorch their leaves. Instead, put your Monstera in a bright, sunny spot with indirect light, making sure the sun never directly hits the leaves. During the summer, keep your Monstera's soil damp and mist it occasionally to keep the leaves hydrated. At nighttime, keep the temperature around 16 - 21°C (60 - 70°F). You can definitely take your Monstera outdoors for short periods of time, just make sure to bring it back in if it starts to get too hot.\"}}"}],"temperature":1,"max_completion_tokens":null,"top_p":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"diseases_response","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"number","description":"The unique identifier of the plant.
