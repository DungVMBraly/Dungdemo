You care and now we have things in between. I know I'm likely, too attached, and this could be too far to reach, but this aint right, and I been thinking for a while you're in sight and I just can't let go.\nCan't go slow if we aint moving.\nAnd it's deeper than simply wanting relief, that's below.\n\nI care, I do. I really do.\nWe may be quiet no denying that, I love, you! and I love you as my friend, we are close we can't pretend, but it aint wrong to say, it's that nowadays, a guy and a gal, can't oft' be swayed to stay chaste.\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm running, we've been running,\nI fell off the track, and I just can't get you back, now it's funny.\nWe ran together, worked together,\npushed each other harder.\nRunning, falling, and running.\n[End]\n\nLord, I pray right now.\nJust don't take my best friend,\nnot again.\nI'm sorry, I'm rash and I hate, I can forgive,\ncuz you gave me something beautiful I won't outlive.\nI fell cause I ran, but give us another chance!\nPlease, don't take her, again.\n\n[Chorus]\n\n"
